/* Pseudocode */

On-screen text Intro Message
 		System.out.println("Enter customers weekly income");

On-screen calculate weekly income at 10% tax rate
 		weekly income < $500
        taxRate = 0.10

On-screen calculate weekly income at 15% tax rate
 		weekly income >= $500 but less than $1500
        taxRate = 0.15;

On-screen calculate weekly income at 20% tax rate
 		weekly income >= $1500 but less than $2500
        taxRate = 0.20

On-screen calculate weekly income at 30% tax rate
 		weekly income >= $2500
        taxRate = 0.30


calculate weekly tax withholdings = weekly income * tax rate

calculate AVERAGE withholdings = withholdings DIVIDED BY weekly income
 
 On-screen display withholdings average

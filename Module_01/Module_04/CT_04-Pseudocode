Module 4: Critical Thinking - Option #1: Looping Construct with Floating Point Numbers

/* Pseudocode */

Housekeeping initialize;

while loop to keep executing until five sets of floating points have been entered

On-screen text Intro Message
 		System.out.println("Enter floating point No. ");
		add to a 'counter' to keep track of limit to 5 floating point numbers

		keep inserting the input value and compare to the previous/next until MAXIMUM is identified
		if (inVal > max) {
			max = inVal;
		}
		keep inserting the input value and compare to the previous/next until MINIMUM is identified
		else if (inVal < min)  {
			min = inVal;
		} 

		calculate average = total (of five numbers enter by user) then divide by 5;
        calculate interest = total (of five numbers enter by user) then multiply by .2 which is 20%;

        // Need to print TOTAL, AVERAGE, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM, INTEREST on TOTAL at 20%
        System.out.print("The Total is: " + total);  //Only print to decimal places will need to use %.2f
        System.out.print("The Average is: " + average);  //Only print to decimal places will need to use %.2f
        System.out.print("The Max is: " + max);
        System.out.print("The Min is: " + min);
        System.out.print("The Interest is: " + interest);  //Only print to decimal places will need to use %.2f
